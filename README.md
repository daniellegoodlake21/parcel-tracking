# parcel-tracking
I completed this project as a university assignment.
It allows you to simulate ordering products, which are stored as parcels in the database which can then be updated.
Please note that this requires a local database with relevant tables to connect to so it will not work standalone. For a short video demo on me using the working website (alongside other project demos), please visit https://daniellegoodlake21.github.io/cv/programming_experience.html and find the parcel tracking section.
I used Visual Studio Code's PHP Server extension to run the website locally.
